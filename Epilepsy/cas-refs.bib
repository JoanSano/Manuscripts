ABSTRACT={The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eegstudy.org/prepcode" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://eegstudy.org/prepcode</ext-link>.}

abstract = {Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain denoted by frequent seizures. The symptoms of seizure include confusion, abnormal staring, and rapid, sudden, and uncontrollable hand movements. Epileptic seizure detection methods involve neurological exams, blood tests, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging modalities. Among these, neuroimaging modalities have received considerable attention from specialist physicians. One method to facilitate the accurate and fast diagnosis of epileptic seizures is to employ computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on deep learning (DL) and neuroimaging modalities. This paper has studied a comprehensive overview of DL methods employed for epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities. First, DL-based CADS for epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities are discussed. Also, descriptions of various datasets, preprocessing algorithms, and DL models which have been used for epileptic seizures detection and prediction have been included. Then, research on rehabilitation tools has been presented, which contains brain-computer interface (BCI), cloud computing, internet of things (IoT), hardware implementation of DL techniques on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc. In the discussion section, a comparison has been carried out between research on epileptic seizure detection and prediction. The challenges in epileptic seizures detection and prediction using neuroimaging modalities and DL models have been described. In addition, possible directions for future works in this field, specifically for solving challenges in datasets, DL, rehabilitation, and hardware models, have been proposed. The final section is dedicated to the conclusion which summarizes the significant findings of the paper.}

Epidemiologic studies are necessary to define the full public health burden of epilepsy; to set public health and health care priorities; to provide information needed for prevention, early detection, and treatment; to identify education and service needs; and to promote effective health care and support programs for people with epilepsy. However, different definitions and epidemiologic methods complicate the tasks of these studies and their interpretations and comparisons. The purpose of this document is to promote consistency in definitions and methods in an effort to enhance future population-based epidemiologic studies, facilitate comparison between populations, and encourage the collection of data useful for the promotion of public health. We discuss: (1) conceptual and operational definitions of epilepsy, (2) data resources and recommended data elements, and (3) methods and analyses appropriate for epidemiologic studies or the surveillance of epilepsy. Variations in these are considered, taking into account differing resource availability and needs among countries and differing purposes among studies.},

Thus, before utilising the recorded EEG signal for any kind of diagnosis, the signal must be pre-processed to eliminate the artifacts that have contaminated the signal. In this paper a hybrid approach for denoising the EEG signal is proposed. The approach is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a Blind Source Separation (BSS) technique for elimination of muscular artifacts. In the next step, DFA thresholded EMD process is utilized for the rejection of ocular artifacts. The performance of the proposed hybrid approach is compared with existing techniques on the basis of different performance metrics.}

Artifact removal and noise suppression is essential prior to information extraction from Electroencephalogram signals. In this paper, a novel automated methodology of artifact removal and noise suppression of Electroencephalogram data is proposed. The proposed methodology relies on two distinct techniques such as Independent Component Analysis and Discrete Orthonormal S-Transform. The method is carried out in four methodological steps viz. Blind Source Separation of artifact contaminated Electroencephalographic data in independent components, automated identification of artifactual independent components, Discrete Orthonormal S-Transform denoising of artifactual independent components and reconstruction of clean Electroencephalogram data. The efficacy of the methodology is evaluated on simulated as well as experimental artifactual Electroencephalogram data. The proposed methodology effectively removed large proportion of artifacts and noise while preserved useful cerebral activity.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique for removing the artifacts from the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are influenced by different characteristics, like line interference, EOG (electro-oculogram) and ECG (electrocardiogram). The elimination of artifact from scalp EEGs is of substantial significance for both the automated and visual examination of underlying brainwave actions. These noise sources increase the difficulty in analyzing the EEG and obtaining clinical information related to pathology. Hence it is crucial to design a procedure to decrease such artifacts in EEG records. This paper uses Spatially-Constrained Independent Component Analysis (SCICA) to separate the Independent Components (ICs) from the initial EEG signal. As the next step, Wavelet Denoising (WD) is applied to extract the brain activity from purged artifacts, and finally the artifacts are projected back and subtracted from EEG signals to get clean EEG data. Here, thresholding plays an important role in delineating the artifacts and hence a better thresholding technique called Otsu’, thresholding is applied. Experimental results show that the proposed technique results in better removal of artifacts.}

For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.}

This manuscript is based on the notion that the full capacity of the EEG artifact removal methods can be achieved while addressing the associated challenges well. Because these methods could enhance the inferences deduced from the EEG data. The focus of this manuscript is to elaborate challenges (e.g., the algorithm-specific challenges and general challenges) of the EEG artifact removal methods. Considering the challenges, the manuscript has presented recommendations to address them. The manuscript also provides information on Matlab and Python-based toolboxes developed for EEG preprocessing.

abstract = {Epileptic seizure detection using scalp electroencephalogram (sEEG) and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) has attracted widespread attention in recent two decades. The accurate and rapid detection of seizures not only reflects the efficiency of the algorithm, but also greatly reduces the burden of manual detection during long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. In this work, a stacked one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model combined with a random selection and data augmentation (RS-DA) strategy is proposed for seizure onset detection. Firstly, we segmented the long-term EEG signals using 2-s sliding windows. Then, the 2-s interictal and ictal segments were classified by the stacked 1D-CNN model. During model training, a RS-DA strategy was applied to solve the problem of sample imbalance, and the patient-specific model was trained with event-based K-fold (K is the number of seizures per patient) cross validation for detecting all seizures of each patient. Finally, we evaluated the performances of the proposed approach in the two levels: the segment-based level and the event-based level. The proposed method was tested on two long-term EEG datasets: the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset and the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset. For the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset, we achieved 88.14\% sensitivity, 99.62\% specificity and 99.54\% accuracy in the segment-based level. From the perspective of the event-based level, 99.31\% sensitivity, 0.2/h false detection rate (FDR) and mean 8.1-s latency were achieved. For the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset, in the segment-based level, 90.09\% sensitivity, 99.81\% specificity and 99.73\% accuracy were obtained. In the event-based level, 97.52\% sensitivity, 0.07/h FDR and mean 13.2-s latency were attained. From these results, we can see that our method can effectively use both sEEG and iEEG data to detect epileptic seizures, and this may provide a reference for the clinical application of seizure onset detection.}

abstract = {Identifying epileptic seizures through analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal becomes a standard method for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Manual seizure identification on EEG by trained neurologists is time-consuming, labor-intensive and a reliable automatic seizure/non-seizure classification method is needed. One of the challenges in automatic seizure/non-seizure classification is that seizure morphologies exhibit considerable variabilities. In order to capture essential seizure patterns, this paper leverages an attention mechanism and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to exploit both spatial and temporal discriminating features and overcome seizure variabilities. The attention mechanism captures spatial features according to the contributions of different brain regions to seizures. BiLSTM extracts discriminating temporal features in forward and backward directions. Cross-validation experiments and cross-patient experiments over the noisy data of CHB-MIT were performed. We obtained average sensitivity of 87.30\%, specificity of 88.30\% and precision of 88.29\% in cross-validation experiments, higher than using the current state-of-the-art methods, and the standard deviations were lower. These results indicate that our approach performs well against current state-of-the-art methods and is more robust across patients.}

And these deep features are then given as inputs to train a support vector machine (SVM) for recognition of epileptic seizures. The experiments are carried out with two authoritative databases provided by the Bonn University (Database A) and Children’s Hospital in Boston (Database B), relatively. Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of all parameters for the proposed scheme to obtain the optimal model with better generalization and expansibility. The proposed feature learning method concerned in this work is proved very useful to distinguish seizure events from both short and long EEG recordings. Experimental results obtained by analyzing Database A are not less than 99\% accuracy in seven problems. The effectiveness is also verified on Database B with an average accuracy of 98.47\% across 23 patients.

abstract = {Background and Objectives: Epilepsy is a clinical phenomenon caused by sudden abnormal and excessive discharge of brain neurons. It affects around 70 million people all over the world. Seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) has achieved rapid development. However, existing methods often extract features from single channel EEG while ignoring the spatial relationship between different EEG channels. To fill this gap, a novel seizure detection model based on linear graph convolution network (LGCN) was proposed to enhance the feature embedding of raw EEG signals during seizure and non-seizure periods. Method: Pearson correlation matrix of raw EEG signals was calculated to build the input graph of the graph neural network where the coefficients of the matrix models the spatial relations in EEG signals. The last softmax layer makes the final decision (seizure vs. non-seizure). In addition, focal loss was utilized to redefine the loss function of LGCN to deal with the data imbalance problem during seizure detection. Results: Experiments are conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset. The seizure detection accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1 and Auc are 99.30\%, 98.82\%, 99.43\%, 98.73\% and 98.57\% respectively. Conclusions: The proposed approach yields superior performance over the-state-of-the-art in seizure detection tasks on the CHB-MIT dataset. Our method works in an end-to-end manner and it does not need manually designed features. The ability to deal with imbalanced data is also attractive in real seizure detection scenarios where the duration of seizures is much shorter than the lasting time of non-seizure events.}

ABSTRACT={Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease that causes persistent and severe damage to the physical and mental health of patients. Daily effective prediction of epileptic seizures is crucial for epilepsy patients especially those with refractory epilepsy. At present, a large number of deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks have been used to predict epileptic seizures and have obtained better performance than traditional machine learning methods. However, these methods usually transform the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal into a Euclidean grid structure. The conversion suffers from loss of adjacent spatial information, which results in deep learning models requiring more storage and computational consumption in the process of information fusion after information extraction. This study proposes a general Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model architecture for predicting seizures to solve the problem of oversized seizure prediction models based on exploring the graph structure of EEG signals. As a graph classification task, the network architecture includes graph convolution layers that extract node features with one-hop neighbors, pooling layers that summarize abstract node features; and fully connected layers that implement classification, resulting in superior prediction performance and smaller network size. The experiment shows that the model has an average sensitivity of 96.51\%, an average AUC of 0.92, and a model size of 15.5 k on 18 patients in the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Compared with traditional deep learning methods, which require a large number of parameters and computational effort and are demanding in terms of storage space and energy consumption, this method is more suitable for implementation on compact, low-power wearable devices as a standard process for building a generic low-consumption graph network model on similar biomedical signals. Furthermore, the edge features of graphs can be used to make a preliminary determination of locations and types of discharge, making it more clinically interpretable.}

	abstract = {Object Electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and are very susceptible to muscular, ambient noise, and other artifacts. Many artifact removal algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. However, the evaluation of these algorithms is conventionally too indirect (e.g., black-box comparisons of brain-computer interface performance before and after removal) because it is unclear which part of the signal represents raw EEG and which is noise. This project objectively benchmarks popular artifact removal algorithms and evaluates the fundamental Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approach thanks to a unique dataset where EEG is recorded simultaneously with other physiological signals-facial electromyography (EMG), accelerometers, and gyroscope-while ten subjects perform several repetitions of common artifact-inflicting tasks (blinking, speaking, etc.).Approach I have compared the correlation between EEG signals and the artifact-representing channels before and after applying an artifact removal algorithm across the different artifact-inflicting tasks. The extent to which an artifact removal method can reduce this correlation objectively quantifies its effectiveness for the different artifacts. In the same direction, I have determined to what extent ICA successfully detects artefactual components in EEG by comparing the corresponding correlations for independent components that are labelled as artifacts with those labeled as EEG.Main result The FORCe was found to be the most effective and generic artifact removal method, cleaning almost 40\% of artifacts. ICA is shown to be able to isolate almost 70\% of artefactual components.Significance This work alleviates the problem of unreliable evaluation of EEG artifact removal frameworks and provides the first reliable benchmark for the most popular algorithms in this literature.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

ABSTRACT = {Identifying subjects with epileptic seizures or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures from healthy subjects via interictal EEG analysis can be a very challenging issue. Indeed, at visual inspection, EEG can be normal in both cases. This paper proposes an automatic diagnosis approach based on deep learning to differentiate three classes: subjects with epileptic seizures (ES), subjects with non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (PNES) and control subjects (CS), analyzed by non-invasive low-density interictal scalp EEG recordings. The EEGs of 42 patients with new-onset ES, 42 patients with PNES video recorded and 19 patients with CS all with normal interictal EEG on visual inspection, were analyzed in the study; none of them was taking psychotropic drugs before registration. The processing pipeline applies empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to 5s EEG segments of 19 channels in order to extract enhanced features learned automatically from the customized convolutional neural network (CNN). The resulting CNN has been shown to perform well during classification, with an accuracy of 85.7\%; these results encourage the use of deep processing systems to assist clinicians in difficult clinical settings.},

abstract="A high mental workload level could significantly contribute to mental fatigue, decreased performance, or long-term health problems [14]. Recently, deep learning models have been trained on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect users' mental workload. While such approaches show promising results, they either ignore the noise element inherent in the EEG signals or apply a random set of preprocessing techniques to reduce the noise. Such a lack of uniform preprocessing techniques in cleaning the EEG signals would not allow the comparison of the effectiveness of deep learning models across different studies even when they use the data collected from the same experiment. Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate the effect of preprocessing techniques defined by neuroscientists in the effectiveness of deep learning models. To do so, we focused on the preprocessing techniques that can be automated and do not need any human intervention, namely a high-pass filter, the ADJUST algorithm, and a re-referencing. Using a publicly available mental workload dataset, STEW, we investigate the effect of these preprocessing techniques in three state-of-the-art deep learning models named Stacked LSTM, BLSTM, and BLSTM-LSTM. Our results show that ADJUST has the most significant effect on the performance of our models compare to other steps. Our findings also show that EEG signals that were prepossessed using the high-pass filter, ADJUST algorithm and re-referencing provided the highest classification performance across the investigated deep learning models. We believe this paper provides an important step towards defining a uniform methodological framework for using deep learning models on EEG signals.",

First we apply it to a fractional Brownian function [1] which has a property of self-similarity for all scales, and we can get the stable and precise fractal dimension. This technique is also applied to the observational data of natural phenomena. It does not show self-similarity all over the scale but has a different self-similarity across the characteristic time scale. The present method gives us a stable characteristic time scale as well as the fractal dimension.}

The rapid development in the field of deep learning shows promise in the creation of automated models performing EEG signal classification. However, EEG data requires careful artifact removal, as well as strategies for dealing with inherent imbalance present within samples extracted from epileptic patients. In this work, a simple graph neural network (GNN) using attention to perform classification of EEG segments is proposed. We also elaborate on the effectiveness of signal pre-processing and imbalance handling methods, showing their impact on the model's performance. The results demonstrate that the classificator's performance can be enhanced by choosing proper pre-processing and signal balancing methods. We anticipate that these approaches can be adopted by the researchers working on EEG classification with deep learning models, helping to improve the the robustness of constructed models.",

ABSTRACT={Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key approach to measure the rhythmic oscillations of neural activity, which is one of the core technologies of brain-computer interface systems (BCIs). However, extraction of the features from non-linear and non-stationary EEG signals is still a challenging task in current algorithms. With the development of artificial intelligence, various advanced algorithms have been proposed for signal classification in recent years. Among them, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the most attractive type of method due to their end-to-end structure and powerful ability of automatic feature extraction. However, it is difficult to collect large-scale datasets in practical applications of BCIs, which may lead to overfitting or weak generalizability of the classifier. To address these issues, a promising technique has been proposed to improve the performance of the decoding model based on data augmentation (DA). In this article, we investigate recent studies and development of various DA strategies for EEG classification based on DNNs. The review consists of three parts: what kind of paradigms of EEG-based on BCIs are used, what types of DA methods are adopted to improve the DNN models, and what kind of accuracy can be obtained. Our survey summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes that aim to promote or guide the deployment of DA to EEG classification in future research and development.}

We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (mdps) and partially observable MDPs (pomdps). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving pomdps off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to pomdps, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions.}

It has been shown that the design of preprocessing procedures can affect subsequent EEG data analysis outcomes. Preprocessing of EEG largely includes a number of processes, such as line noise removal, adjustment of referencing, elimination of bad EEG channels, and artifact removal. This chapter presents an overview of the methods available for each process and discusses practical considerations for applying these methods to the EEG signals. In particular, considerable attention is paid to the state-of-the-art artifact removal methods since there are still plenty of opportunities to enhance the artifact removal techniques for EEG, in the perspectives of both signal processing and neuroscience. It is desirable that this chapter provides the readers an overall view of EEG preprocessing pipelines and serves as a handbook guide for the practice of EEG preprocessing.",

abstract = {EEG changes during the perinatal period, infancy, childhood, and adolescence are concomitant with brain growth, myelination, expanding connectivity, and overall maturation, which are particularly fast during the first year of life. EEG aspects of early brain development are accessible in preterm during the third trimester of gestational age, and they evolve to full-term, infancy, and childhood EEG patterns. Each of these age periods shares specific EEG features that reach gross adult outlines in the first year. Interpreting EEG needs therefore a deep knowledge of pathological and normal EEG patterns with their variants belonging to each age range. Recording EEG during these periods also requires adapting the recording techniques to the specific age in order to obtain interpretable records. This chapter describes normal EEG features and variants, characteristic patterns of development, and some patterns that are unusual for age, from the neonatal period to adolescence.}
