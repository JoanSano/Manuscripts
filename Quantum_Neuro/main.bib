              In this paper I propose a new method of encoding discrete variables into Ising model qubits for quantum optimisation. The new method is based on the physics of domain walls in one-dimensional Ising spin chains. I find that these encodings and the encoding of arbitrary two variable interactions is possible with only two body Ising terms Following on from similar results for the ‘one hot’ method of encoding discrete variables (Hadfield
              et al
              2019
              Algorithms
              12
              34) I also demonstrate that it is possible to construct two body mixer terms which do not leave the logical subspace, an important consideration for optimising using the quantum alternating operator ansatz. I additionally discuss how, since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be ferromagnetic and therefore could in principle be much stronger than anti-ferromagnetic couplers, application specific quantum annealers for discrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I compare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the domain wall and one hot encodings on two graphs which are relevant for quantum annealing, the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph. For every case I examine I find a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared to one hot, but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the problem. For encoding some problems, I find an advantage similar to the one found by embedding in a Pegasus graph compared to embedding in a chimera graph.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers it is crucial to design quantum algorithms which do not require many qubits or deep circuits. Unfortunately, most of the well-known quantum algorithms are too demanding to be run on currently available quantum devices. Moreover, even the state-of-the-art algorithms developed for the NISQ era often suffer from high space complexity requirements for particular problem classes. In this paper, we show that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a paradigmatic optimization task, at the cost of having deeper variational circuits. While the focus is on this particular problem, we claim that the approach can be generalized for other problems where the standard bit-encoding is highly inefficient. Finally, we also propose encoding schemes which smoothly interpolate between the qubit-efficient and the circuit depth-efficient models. All the proposed encodings have the same volume up to polylogarithmic factors and remain efficient to implement within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm framework.},
